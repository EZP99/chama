Chama
=======================================

Continuous or regularly scheduled monitoring has the potential to quickly 
identify changes in the environment.  However, even with low-cost sensors, only 
a limited number of sensors can be used. 
The physical placement of these sensors and the sensor technology used can have 
a large impact on the performance of a monitoring strategy.  

Chama is a python package which includes mixed-integer, stochastic 
programming formulations to determine sensor locations and technology that maximize 
the effectiveness of the detection program. 
The software was developed to design sensor networks for airborne pollutants, 
but the methods are general and 
can be applied to a wide range of transport models.
