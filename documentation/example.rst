Methane emissions example
==================

The following example demonstrates how to determine optimal sensor design to detect methane emissions from a wellpad.
The example outlines how to perform the following steps:

* **Define scenarios** which include uncertainty in wind speed and direction along with the rate of normal and abnormal emissions.

* **Define sensors**, including fixed and mobile sensors as well as point and camera sensors.

* **Run an air dispersion model** and store concentration timeseries data.

* **Compute impact metrics**, including time to detection and volume lost.

* **Determine optimal sensor design** considering a range of sensor budgets.

* **Visualize results**, including tradoff curves and maps of the sensor layout.
