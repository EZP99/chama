Methane emissions example
===========================

The following example demonstrates how to determine optimal sensor placement to detect methane emissions from a wellpad.

**Transport simulation**

Include uncertainty in wind speed and direction along with the rate of normal and abnormal emissions.
Run an air dispersion model and store concentration timeseries data.

**Sensor technology**

Including fixed and mobile sensors as well as point and camera sensors.

**Impact assessment**

Including time to detection and volume lost.

**Optimization**

Considering a range of sensor budgets.

**Graphics**

Including tradeoff curves and maps of the sensor layout.
