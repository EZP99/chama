Graphics
===========================

The :mod:`chama.graphics` module provides methods to help visualize results. 

Signal Maps
---------------------------
Once signal information has been loaded into Python or generated using
the :mod:`chama.transport` module, Chama provides several functions for
visualizing that signal. These functions are useful for verifying that
the signal was loaded/generated as expected, visualizing the signal over
several scenarios, or understanding optimal the sensor placement
returned by the :mod:`chama.optimization` module.

Convex Hull Plot
***************************
Chama provides a function for visualizing the convex hull of a signal in
3-D. This is useful for understanding the total 3-D area covered by the
signal. A sample of this plot is shown below.

Cross Section Contour Plot
***************************
Another way to visualize the signal is using contour plots. Chama
includes a function for generating cross-section contour plots from the
Pandas DataFrame generated by the :mod:`chama.transport` module or
provided to the :mod:`chama.solver` module. These plots provide more
information about the magnitude of the signal at a given location than
the convex hull plot. A sample plot is shown below.

Gaussian Puff Animation
****************************
As described in the :ref:`transport` section, one of the internal
simulation engines included in Chama is a Gaussian puff air dispersion
model. The :mod:`chama.graphics` module provides a method for
visualizing the movements of each puff over the simulation horizon. A
sample frame from the animation generated by this function is shown
below.
